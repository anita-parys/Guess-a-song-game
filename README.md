# Guess-a-song-game

## Project description

The idea of the project is based on YouTube tutorial about creating a virtual quiz game using AI. Game requires constant access to the camera in order to scan for user's hands.
User can answer a question by using hands to choose the answer.
The game is a mix of mentioned tutorial and popular game called heads up, in witch a player who doesn't see the name of a song needs to guess the song while other players are singing

- The dataset "songs.csv" includes 62 popular songs with attributes such as title and singer, which provides the abbility to run the code and play the game. You can add songs or create your own list with your favourite songs based on this file.
